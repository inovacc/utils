Let me explain the purpose and use cases for each data structure implementation:

1. **Set (`set.go`)**
- Best for: Maintaining a collection of unique elements
- Use cases:
    - Removing duplicates from data
    - Tracking unique visitors/items
    - Set operations (membership testing)
- Time complexity: O(1) average for Add, Remove, Has operations

2. **Stack (`stack.go`)**
- Best for: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations
- Use cases:
    - Function call tracking
    - Undo/redo operations
    - Expression parsing
    - Backtracking algorithms
- Time complexity: O(1) for Push, Pop, Peek operations

3. **Priority Queue (`priority_queue.go`)**
- Best for: Managing elements with different priorities
- Use cases:
    - Task scheduling
    - Event handling systems
    - Network packet prioritization
    - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Time complexity: O(log n) for Push and Pop operations

4. **Linked List (`linked_list.go`)**
- Best for: Sequential data with frequent insertions/deletions
- Use cases:
    - Dynamic data collection
    - Implementation of other data structures
    - Memory efficient when frequent insertions/deletions are needed
- Time complexity: O(n) for access, O(1) for insertion at known position

5. **Ring Buffer (`ring_buffer.go`)**
- Best for: Fixed-size circular queue implementations
- Use cases:
    - Stream processing
    - Audio/video buffering
    - Memory-efficient queue with fixed capacity
    - Real-time data handling
- Time complexity: O(1) for all operations

6. **Queue (`queue.go`)**
- Best for: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations
- Use cases:
    - Task queues
    - Message processing
    - Breadth-first search
    - Request handling
- Time complexity: O(1) for Enqueue and Dequeue operations

7. **Merge Utilities (`merge.go`)**
- Best for: Struct manipulation and configuration management
- Use cases:
    - Configuration merging
    - Object cloning
    - Default value handling
    - Struct to map conversion for serialization

These implementations are all generic, meaning they can work with any comparable type in Go. They provide type-safe operations while maintaining good performance characteristics for their intended use cases.
